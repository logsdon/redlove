# RedLove

RedLove is a homegrown collection of toolkits, tricks, tweaks, and templates for web projects.

It's a culmination inspired by web folk and their solutions, fed by the privilege and joy of creating something from nothing, and cultivated over time through experiments and experiences. Attribution for supporting resources or originating thoughts, all of which have no affiliation, have been preserved where applicable or remembered.

Why yet another set of solutions alongside more established ones? To learn and grow in the process of creating them... for the joy and frustration of figuring things out for one's own understanding... I don't know; why do anything at all if it's already been done before? :)

## More to It

This project isn't perfect but nothing here on earth is. If you are feeling lost and alone, and not just on a project, there's hope for everyone, and I'd love for you to [know it](http://fbccolumbus.com/i-am-new/becoming-a-christian).
