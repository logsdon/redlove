# RedLove

RedLove is a homegrown collection of toolkits, tricks, tweaks, templates, and other things that start with a "t" for web projects.

It's a culmination inspired by web folk and their solutions, fed by the privilege and joy of creating something from nothing, and cultivated over time through experiments and experiences. Attribution for supporting resources or originating thoughts, all of which have no affiliation, have been preserved where applicable or remembered.

>*Why yet another set of solutions alongside more established ones?* To learn and grow in the process of creating them... for the joy and frustration of figuring things out for one's own understanding... I don't know; why do anything at all if it's already been done before? :)

>Even with the Internet at my fingertips, I find myself hitting up these resources and references time and time again.

## Heart and Passion

This project isn't perfect but nothing here on earth is. It's what I've felt lead to do with the life I've had and now share it with you.

We, technology, and our self-indulgences will pass in time with little more to show for them than an anonymous effect on what comes after. Life is a vapor. That shouldn't be depressing. It should be inspiring to appreciate and make the most of your time, whether it's with work, relationships, or seeking a balance.

I and this project are nothing remarkable. There are a plethora of them out there. What makes this one different is it's what I have to offer, for better or worse. Don't be discouraged or double-minded. Be decisive and do your best, whether or not it's good enough for you or someone else.

### Love

If you ever wonder about direction in your life or what comes after, it can be overwhelming to think about or awkward to ask. Like with code, sometimes there is a quick, direct solution and sometimes there is a deeper condition to address first.

The greatest thing in my life, what's seen me through all times is love. For me, Jesus is love. If you have a mixed reaction right now, that was me too. :) He may never have been seriously discussed with you, has been misrepresented, was flippantly tossed out at you like an elusive holy fix-all whose name you just speak and life is peachy, you were pressured into doing or believing things you aren't comfortable with, you feel you will never have a life if you follow Him, someone you believed a Christian shamed or hurt you because of your lifestyle or past, awful things have burdened you or loved ones in life, etc. and so you tabled all that off to the side in frustration or confusion. I get it, we're all human.

That's unfortunate and it's my greatest desire that you not leave it that way. There's no one better than another; we're all sinners. That's who Jesus came for, not to condemn but to love. It wasn't until I had a desperate need for Him in my life that I better learned to separate the truth from the world. That lead to a greater understanding and meaningful relationship with Him.

Hey, did you know that code can be complicated? Yeah, so can these types of discussions. Please seek out answers to your questions. Seeking and finding is good. As a closing one-liner:

If you are feeling lost or have questions in life that are out of project scope, there's a hope for everyone, and I'd love for you to [know it](http://fbccolumbus.com/i-am-new/becoming-a-christian).
