Safari
To reload a page and bypass the cache:
for version 4 and newer:
Hold down the Shift key and click the Reload toolbar button.

for version 3 and older:
Hold down the Cmd key, and press R. This kind of “regular” reload will usually bypass the cache.

Note that Apple claims that clicking the "Reload" toolbar button has the same effect as Cmd+R, but this is not true; frequently the button will not bypass the cache. In some cases both clearing the cache (see below) and then quitting and relaunching the application is necessary.

To completely clear the cache:
From the "Safari" menu, choose "Empty Cache..." or hold down the Opt and Cmd keys and press E.

or: Hold down Shift and press F5.
