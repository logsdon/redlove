Here's how I can best keep short and informative on what I do to take a design and make it a web site.

After the design process, we create a website by bringing several web technologies together.

1) Markup (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
We create markup for every page. Markup is the text building blocks of a web page, the first step in taking a design concept to a page visitors can interact with. When you view the source of a web page, you are looking at markup.

2) Layout, stylesheets, and visuals
We enhance the markup with layout, stylesheets, and visuals. Layout (restructure markup for formatting), stylesheets (apply visual formatting to markup [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets]), and visuals (images and such) are used to recreate the design concept as a web page.

3) Templating
We create web pages with the resources we have developed, tweaking resources as we go. We link up navigation and other shared resources to create a web site.

4) Testing
With several popular web browsers and operating systems visitors may use, we test our pages to ensure a consistent and acceptable visitor experience.

5) Launch
We make sure the web site is set up and available for visitors.
